## Statementof the problem
Traditionally, customers are used to buying the products at the real, in other words, factual
shops or supermarkets. It needs the customers to show up in the shops in person, and walk around
different shopping shelves, and it also needs the owners of shops to stock, exhibit, and transfer the
products required by customers. It takes labour, time and space to process these operations.


Furthermore, the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic has caused a lot of changes in our
lifestyle, people fearing to get outside their homes, transportation almost shut down and social
distancing becoming all the more important. Big to small scale business that relied on the traditional
incur a lot of consequence due to the lockdown issues. Some tend to more towards using social
media platforms like Facebook to sell their product. However, the social media platforms have been
beneficial for marketing purposes alone but leaves the whole task of customer and massive order
management via direct messaging (DM), which takes a lot of time to respond to all customers.
In addition, everyone tends to use social media, posing a great challenge to differentiate between
scammers (fraudsters) and legit sellers. 

### The Solution

La BELLE Fashions Store is an Online shopping system provides a solution to reduce and
optimize these expenses. Authorized Customers do not need to go to the factual shops to choose,
and bring the products they need by hands. They simply browse their Personal computers or cell
phones to access shops, and evaluate the products description, pictures on the screen to choose
products. In addition, the owners of the shop do not need to arrange or exhibit their stocks
products. 


They just input the description, prices of products, and upload their pictures. Simply, both
customers and shop owners do not need to touch the real products in the whole process of
shopping, and management. In the end the logistic centre will distribute the products required by
customers, or products ordered by shop owners to their locations. 

The customers are able to track
the status of their orders until delivery, after which they can leave a review of the type of service
they received. The payment and productsâ€™ quantity will be saved in database through the data flow.
These shopping, management and distribution processes greatly simplify and optimize the retail
business.
